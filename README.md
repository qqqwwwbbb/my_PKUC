# django-polls
A place for creating polls made in Django

### Motivation

Building over the *official* [django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/),
I added the following functionalities :
- User registration and login system
- Poll creation facility for users
- One user can vote only once for a question
- Users can upload/change their profile picture
- Posted questions appear along with who posted them
